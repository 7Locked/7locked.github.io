# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. Contributions are welcome and appreciated — whether you are reporting a problem, requesting a feature, improving documentation, or proposing code changes.

---

## Reporting Issues and Requesting Features

The **Issues** tab is the primary place to report bugs, request new features, or suggest improvements.

When opening an issue, please include:
- A clear, descriptive title.
- A concise summary of the problem or request.
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs), including expected and actual behavior.
- For feature requests, the motivation and benefit to the project.
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or sample code.

### 🏷 Labeling Your Issue
To help maintainers categorize and manage contributions effectively:
- Use the **`enhancements`** label for **feature requests** or **code contributions** that add new functionality.
- If your proposed code **fixes bugs**, also apply the **`enhancements`** label.
- Use the **`bug`** label if your issue is **only describing a bug** without suggesting code or features.

### 💡 Linking Pull Requests
If you are **suggesting code changes** along with your issue, open a **pull request** and **link it to the issue** (for example, include `Closes #123` in the pull request description).  
If you are **only suggesting a feature or idea**, simply explain it clearly in the issue — a pull request is not required.

Well-documented and properly labeled issues help maintainers and contributors respond more quickly and effectively.

## Community Discussions

Use the **Discussions** tab for broader conversations that do not yet belong in Issues, such as:
- Open-ended questions about the project.
- Design proposals and brainstorming.
- Requests for feedback on large or experimental ideas.
- Coordination of work among contributors.

If you are unsure whether to open an issue or start a discussion, Discussions are a good place to begin the conversation.

## Contributing Code or Documentation

To contribute code or documentation, please follow this workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes (use a descriptive branch name).
3. Implement your changes and include tests where appropriate.
4. Keep commits focused and well described.
5. Submit a pull request to the main repository with a clear explanation of the changes and their purpose.

Pull requests should:
- Be scoped to a single purpose or feature.
- Include tests or manual verification steps when applicable.
- Follow existing code style and repository conventions.
- Reference any related issue (for example, “Fixes #123” or “Implements #456”).
- Use the **`enhancements`** label if your pull request adds new features or fixes bugs through code.

---

## Pull Request Review

All contributions are subject to review. During review:
- Expect constructive feedback; please be responsive and professional.
- Maintainers may request changes or additional tests.
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge the pull request or request additional reviewers if necessary.

---

## Requesting Repository Access / Permissions

If you would like direct write access to the repository (for example, as a collaborator or maintainer), please follow one of these two approaches:

1. Open an issue titled `Permission Request` and include:
   - Your GitHub username.
   - A short description of the role or access level you are requesting.
   - Why you should be granted the requested permissions (experience, prior contributions, planned responsibilities).

2. Alternatively, start a thread in **Discussions** (category: Access / Maintainers) and provide the same information.

Requests will be evaluated and responded to by a project maintainer. Note that granting owner-level permissions will be considered carefully.

---

## Code of Conduct

All participants are expected to maintain professional and respectful conduct during interactions in Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions. Unprofessional or abusive behavior will not be tolerated.

---

## Additional Notes

- If you are submitting multiple unrelated changes, consider splitting them into separate pull requests to simplify review.
- If you are proposing a large or complex change, open a discussion first to gather feedback before investing significant effort.
- If you are unsure how to get started, open an issue or discussion and we will help guide you to an appropriate first task.
